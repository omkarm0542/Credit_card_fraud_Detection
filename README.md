# Introduction
Credit card fraud is a significant concern for financial institutions and customers alike. This project aims to develop a credit card fraud detection system that can identify fraudulent transactions in real-time. The system leverages machine learning techniques to analyze transaction data and classify transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate.

# Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the project:

* Python 3.6+
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
# Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
> git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit-card-fraud-detection.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
> cd credit-card-fraud-detection
3. Install the required dependencies:
> pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
1. Run the main.py script to start the credit card fraud detection system:
> python main.py
2. Follow the prompts to input the transaction details.
3. The system will classify the transaction as fraudulent or legitimate based on the trained machine learning model.

# Data
The credit card transaction data used in this project is not included in this repository. You can obtain a suitable dataset from various sources, such as Kaggle or other public repositories. Make sure to download the dataset and place it in the data/ directory before proceeding with data preprocessing and model training.

# Data Preprocessing
The preprocess_data.py script is responsible for data preprocessing tasks. It loads the raw dataset, performs data cleaning, feature engineering, and prepares the data for model training.

To preprocess the data, follow these steps:

1. Place the raw dataset file (data.csv) in the data/ directory.
2. Run the preprocess_data.py script:
> python preprocess_data.py

1. Model Training
The train_model.py script trains a machine learning model using the preprocessed data. It splits the data into training and testing sets, trains the model, and saves it for future use.

To train the model, follow these steps:

Ensure that the data preprocessing step has been completed.
Run the train_model.py script:
> python train_model.py


2. Model Evaluation
The evaluate_model.py script evaluates the performance of the trained model using the test data. It computes various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

To evaluate the model, follow these steps:

Ensure that the model training step has been completed.
Run the evaluate_model.py script:
> python evaluate_model.py

# Deployment
This project can be deployed in various ways depending on your requirements. Some possible deployment options include:

1. Creating a web application using Flask or Django.
2. Building an API using FastAPI or other frameworks.
3. Integrating the fraud detection system into an existing banking or payment
